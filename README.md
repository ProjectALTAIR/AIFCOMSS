# AIFCOMSS

Requires the prior installation of:

 1) node.js ( https://nodejs.org/en/ ) <br>
 2) Cesium ( http://cesiumjs.org/downloads.html ) <br>
 3) p5.js ( https://p5js.org/download/ ) <br>

Install each one of the above three, then:

 a) Download this (AIFCOMSS) repository to your Cesium main directory (which should replace the default server.js file that Cesium has included), <br>
 b) In that same Cesium main directory, type  "node server.js | tee <<yourlogfile.log>>" , <br>
 c) Then, in a web browser, go to:  http://localhost:8080/AIFCOMSS.html . <br>

You should then have AIFCOMSS running in your web browser.

Please ask me any questions that come up (jalbert@uvic.ca).
